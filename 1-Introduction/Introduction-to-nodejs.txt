INTRODUCTION TO NODEJS
-- Nodejs is an open source and cross platform javascript runtime environment
-- Nodejs runs on the V8 javascript engine
-- Nodejs app runs on a single process, without creating a new thread for every request
-- Nodejs uses event driven, non blocking I/O model to handle concurrent request with single thread

ADVANTAGES OF USING NODEJS
-- JavaScript everywhere (Client and Server)
-- Fast Performance
-- Lightweight: Build in event driven architecture
-- Mordern Architecture and Scalability
-- Cross Platform: Creating APIs
-- Vast number of Libraries and Packages

BUILD APPS WITH NODEJS
-- Streaming web applications like Netflix, Amazon
-- Realtime web applications like Chat, Instant Messaging(IM)
-- Microservices and IOT applications
-- Build MERN stack applications like Ecommerce, Payments
-- Create Restful APIs

NODEJS VS BROWSER
-- Both the Browser and Nodejs use javascript as their programming language
-- Building apps that runs in the Browser is a completely different thing than building a Nodejs application
-- With Browser we have access to DOM, Web API where as with Nodejs we have modules provice to access the file system, OS
